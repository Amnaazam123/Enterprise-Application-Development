These steps will create project for you. There will be thre folders named as Models, Views and Controllers.
Before continuing:
I Deleted default controller.
  To add new controller - right click on Controller folder > add > controller > empty controller > YourControllerNameController.cs > add
  This will create default action method. You can add your own action methods.
  (Action methods : The methods Which will return any view/interface after some particular action. filhal ap url ko change kr kr k particular view dekho gay accordingly)
      
      For html code we use views folder.
        In views folder, hr controller k against aik folder bnana hota
