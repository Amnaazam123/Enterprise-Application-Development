Object to relation mapper(ORM):

Objects in memory ---> ORM ---> Relations   (ORM converts objects to Relations when moving in forword direction.)
Objects in memory <--- ORM <--- Relations   (ORM converts relations(SQL Query) to objects when moving in reverse direction.)

ORM writes query for you. You do nod need to write sql query by yourself.
ORM ho skta hai perfect query na bna sky, tou is k liye hmey query likhni b par skti. is k liye hm DB k andr stored procedure likhen gy.
ORM - usage 80-90%
Queries - usage 10-20%

ORM:
-generates query
-basically uses LINQ.
-converts objects to relations. 

ORM is classified into 2 classes
1 - Entity Framework
2 - Depper

How EF wrks????
DB CONTEXT : represents active session with DB. DB se data get ya save krny k liye ye class use hoti. It has DBSet<T> properties which are made against tables.e.g agr student ka table hai tou student ki aik class bnaeny gy(Entity class) aur hm BDSet<student> kahen gy.
              used for connection management.
              Bridge netween SQL and program.
EF CORE PROVIDER :  it coverts your queries to SQL queries which you define using objects in class.(it converts objects into queries.)
                    -it generates query.
                    
DB PROVIDER: it tells which DB you will use?

There are 2 terms
-DB FIRST:
          You have tables and you have to make classes accordingly.
-CODE FIRST:
          You have classes and you have to make tables accordingly.



WE WILL USE USE DB FIRST TODAY.
