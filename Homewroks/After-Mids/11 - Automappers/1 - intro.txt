Automappers:
Normally, We map each coloumn value to any class object. If you have small number of coloumns in table then it is easy to get any record from coloumns through any query
and map those record values into class object. But what if you have large number of properties?
1 - We can map any wrong coloumn to any wrong property. 
2 - There is many redundancy of these line of codes.
3 - There is time wastage as well.

so, we will use automappers.

For this
Create MVC project is visual studio.
install package through package manager:
- Automappers.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection

And start writing code.
Happy Coding :)
