Create project
Add class "Employee" in Model folder.
Add two folders "repositories" and "interfaces" in Mofdel folder.
In Interfaces folder, we make interface classes.
In repositories folder, we make classes "EmployeeRepository" which provide definition for interfaces (:IEmployee).
Update program.cs file and tell about which interface is being implemented by which class.
